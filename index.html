    <h2>CMU-TAU International Summer School on Formal Specifications
    and Analysis for Software Engineers (SPECS)</h2>
    <p>
    Software is playing an increasingly critical role in our society,
    being used to control complex systems such as medical devices,
    intelligent vehicles, critical infrastructure, financial
    applications, and many others.  Formal specifications have a key
    role in software and systems development, as they serve as a
    rigorous bridge between requirements and implementation, between
    the world and the machine. The use of formal specifications has
    the potential to significantly improve the quality of software
    systems, as they encourage software engineers to be precise about
    the systems they build and enable a formal, possibly automatic
    analysis.  However, writing correct specifications, reading them,
    and using them effectively in a software development process, are
    all challenging tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
    The goals of the summer school are to attract graduate students to
    research on formal specifications and to advance the work in this
    area. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The school will We will focus on Alloy and Spectra as cases in point. 
    It will include a mix of lectures by PIs, presentations by attending graduate students, 
    hands-on user level and developer level tutorials on both languages and tools, 
    a mini-hackathon, and discussions about research challenges and opportunities. 
    </p>    
    <p>
    The school is organized by <a href="https://eskang.github.io/">Eunsuk Kang</a> (Carnegie Mellon University, USA) 
    and <a href="https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~maozs/">Shahar Maoz</a> (Tel Aviv University, Israel). 
    We expect to provide free accomadation in TAU university housing and reimberese the travel costs of most participants.
